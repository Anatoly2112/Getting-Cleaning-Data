# run_analysis.R description

Script:

	1. Gets data from Samsung folder.
	2. Creates 1 data set including all subjects, all activities and all variables from test and train sets.
	3. Choose appropriate variables from general data set and creates data set "clear".
	4. Creates data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject  and writes this data into "Data.txt".

#Variables

X, Y, Z: the axis of X, Y and Z (signals can be in the X, Y and Z directions)

t (at the beginning of the variable names): time domain signals

f (at the beginning of the variable names): frequency domain signals

mean: Mean value

std: Standard deviation

meanFreq: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean

frequency

angle: Angle between to vectors

Acc: Acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer (sensor signal).

Gyr: Angular velocity from the smartphone gyroscope (sensor signal).

Body: The signals related to the body of subject (individual) who has been examined.

Jerk: Jerk signals (the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in
time to reach this signal)

Mag: magnitude of the three-dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidean norm

Gravity: The signals related to the gravity.

Subject: The numbers between 1 to 30 which are identifiers of the subjects
(individuals) who carried out the experiment.

Activity: The numbers between 1 to 6 which are identifiers of the activities

Activity_Name: including 6 activities performed by subjects (STANDING, SITTING,
LAYING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS)
